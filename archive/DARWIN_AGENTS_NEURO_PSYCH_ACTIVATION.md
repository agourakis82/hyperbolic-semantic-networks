# 🧠 DARWIN AGENTS ACTIVATION: NEURO + PSYCH DEEP RESEARCH

**Date:** 2025-11-06  
**Mission:** Multi-agent MCTS/PUCT research (35 iterations)  
**Principle:** HONESTIDADE ABSOLUTA - Real science, no hype [[memory:10560840]]  
**Timeline:** No pressure (quality > speed)

---

## 🎯 **MISSION OBJECTIVES:**

### **PRIMARY GOALS:**
1. Find **REAL** patient semantic network data (not just theory)
2. Extract **QUANTITATIVE** metrics from published papers
3. Test sweet spot hypothesis with **ACTUAL** patient data
4. Map brain regions to network hubs with **REAL** fMRI data
5. Identify **HONEST** limitations and gaps

### **HONESTY PRINCIPLES:** [[memory:10560840]]
- ✅ Report what we FIND, not what we HOPE to find
- ✅ Distinguish: (a) published data, (b) meta-analysis, (c) speculation
- ✅ Acknowledge limitations clearly
- ✅ If hypothesis fails, report it honestly
- ✅ Never inflate effect sizes or significance
- ✅ Separate "what we can do NOW" vs. "what needs collaboration"

## 🤖 **AGENT CONFIGURATION:**

### **AGENT 1: PSYCHIATRIC DATA MINER** 🔍
**Role:** Find REAL patient semantic network data  
**Tasks:**
1. Search for published datasets (supplementary materials)
2. Identify papers with extractable network data
3. Contact authors for data if needed
4. Compile patient vs. control networks

**Diseases:** Schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, Depression, Autism  
**Data types:** Verbal fluency, word associations, semantic priming  
**Success metric:** Find ≥3 datasets with computable C/κ

**HONESTY CHECK:**
- If data NOT available → report honestly, don't fabricate
- If only summary statistics → acknowledge limitation
- If need collaboration → state clearly

---

### **AGENT 2: NEUROIMAGING ANALYST** 🧠
**Role:** NeuroSynth/NeuroVault meta-analysis  
**Tasks:**
1. Query NeuroSynth for "semantic", "word", "language"
2. Download activation maps
3. Identify peak coordinates
4. Map to our network hubs (high-degree nodes)

**Analysis:**
- Correlation: brain activation vs. node degree
- Identify: which regions = semantic hubs?
- Test: angular gyrus, temporal pole, DMN

**HONESTY CHECK:**
- Meta-analysis limitations acknowledged
- Correlation ≠ causation stated clearly
- If no correlation found → report honestly

---

### **AGENT 3: LITERATURE DEEP MINER** 📚
**Role:** Find ALL relevant papers + extract data  
**Tasks:**
1. Complete search: Depression, Autism, other disorders
2. Download full PDFs (use Sci-Hub if needed)
3. Extract network metrics from papers/supplements
4. Build dataset: C, κ, degree, for all studies

**Extraction:**
- Look for: adjacency matrices, edge lists, network figures
- Extract: clustering, path length, modularity
- Compile: patient vs. control comparisons

**HONESTY CHECK:**
- If metrics not reported → acknowledge gap
- If need to estimate from figures → note approximation
- If data insufficient → report limitation

---

### **AGENT 4: CRITICAL EVALUATOR** 🔬
**Role:** Honest assessment of findings  
**Tasks:**
1. Evaluate quality of each dataset found
2. Identify confounds and limitations
3. Assess statistical power
4. Rate evidence strength (weak/moderate/strong)

**Criteria:**
- Sample size adequate? (N>20 per group minimum)
- Controls matched? (age, education, etc.)
- Metrics reported? (or inferred?)
- Replication available?

**HONESTY CHECK:**
- Rate EVERY finding (not just positive ones)
- Identify alternative explanations
- Acknowledge what we DON'T know
- If hypothesis not supported → say so clearly

---

### **AGENT 5: HYPOTHESIS TESTER** 📊
**Role:** Test sweet spot predictions  
**Tasks:**
1. Compute C, κ for all patient networks
2. Compare to controls
3. Test: patients OUT of sweet spot?
4. Correlate: geometry deviation vs. symptom severity

**Predictions to test:**
- Schizophrenia: C altered (higher OR lower)
- Alzheimer's: C decreased (fragmented)
- Depression: Varies by subtype
- Brain hubs: Map to high-degree nodes

**HONESTY CHECK:**
- Pre-register predictions (this document!)
- Report ALL results (positive + negative)
- Effect sizes + confidence intervals
- If p>0.05 → acknowledge null finding

---

### **AGENT 6: INTEGRATION SYNTHESIZER** 🎯
**Role:** Consolidate findings honestly  
**Tasks:**
1. Synthesize all agent results
2. Identify converging evidence
3. Highlight contradictions
4. Assess overall strength

**Output:**
- What we PROVED (strong evidence)
- What we FOUND (moderate evidence)
- What we DON'T KNOW (gaps)
- What NEEDS VALIDATION (future work)

**HONESTY CHECK:**
- No overselling
- Clear about limitations
- Realistic publication targets
- Honest acceptance probability estimates

## 🎲 **MCTS/PUCT ORCHESTRATION (35 ITERATIONS):**

### **ITERATION STRATEGY:**

**Iterations 1-10: EXPLORATION**
- Cast wide net across all disorders
- Sample diverse search strategies
- Identify most promising leads
- **Goal:** Find data-rich papers

**Iterations 11-25: EXPLOITATION**
- Focus on highest-value papers
- Deep dive into promising datasets
- Extract maximum information
- **Goal:** Build comprehensive dataset

**Iterations 26-35: VALIDATION**
- Cross-check findings
- Test alternative hypotheses
- Identify limitations
- **Goal:** Honest assessment

### **PUCT FORMULA:**
```
Score = Q(s,a) + c * P(s,a) * sqrt(N(s)) / (1 + N(s,a))

Q(s,a) = Quality (data richness, sample size, metrics available)
P(s,a) = Prior (paper impact, journal quality, citation count)
N(s)   = Visits to state
c      = Exploration constant (tuned for breadth vs. depth)
```

**Optimization targets:**
1. Maximize: data availability (extractable metrics)
2. Maximize: sample size (statistical power)
3. Maximize: replication (multiple studies)
4. Minimize: confounds (matched controls)
