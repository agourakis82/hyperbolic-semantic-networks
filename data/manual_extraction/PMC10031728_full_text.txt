Background and Hypothesis:  Mapping a patient’s speech 
as a network has proved to be a useful way of under-
standing formal thought disorder in psychosis. However, to 
date, graph theory tools have not explicitly modelled the 
semantic content of speech, which is altered in psychosis. 
Study Design:  We developed an algorithm, “netts,” to map 
the semantic content of speech as a network, then applied 
netts to construct semantic speech networks for a general 
population sample (N = 436), and a clinical sample com-
prising patients with first episode psychosis (FEP), people 
at clinical high risk of psychosis (CHR-P), and healthy 
controls (total N = 53).  Study Results:  Semantic speech 
networks from the general population were more connected 
than size-matched randomized networks, with fewer and 
larger connected components, reflecting the nonrandom na-
ture of speech. Networks from FEP patients were smaller 
than from healthy participants, for a picture description 
task but not a story recall task. For the former task, FEP 
networks were also more fragmented than those from con-
trols; showing more connected components, which tended to 
include fewer nodes on average. CHR-P networks showed 
fragmentation values in-between FEP patients and con-
trols. A clustering analysis suggested that semantic speech 
networks captured novel signals not already described by 
existing NLP measures. Network features were also re-
lated to negative symptom scores and scores on the Thought 
and Language Index, although these relationships did not 
survive correcting for multiple comparisons.  Conclusions: 
Overall, these data suggest that semantic networks can 
enable deeper phenotyping of formal thought disorder in 
psychosis. Whilst here we focus on network fragmenta-
tion, the semantic speech networks created by Netts also 
contain other, rich information which could be extracted 
to shed further light on formal thought disorder. We are 
releasing Netts as an open Python package alongside this 
manuscript.

Introduction
One of the great challenges facing psychiatry is mapping 
the complexity and heterogeneity of mental health condi-
tions, including psychotic disorders. Although psychotic 
disorders are recognized for their multifaceted and di-
verse phenotypes, objectively describing and measuring 
these remains difficult. Generating new approaches for 
the automated analysis and quantification of psychotic 
symptoms could not only significantly diversify the tools 
available to probe this debilitating condition, but also aid 
disease monitoring and early diagnosis.
A core symptom of psychosis is formal thought dis-
order (FTD), manifesting as changes in the patient’s 
speech which can appear incoherent and disorganized. 
FTD has several dimensions, as described by the Thought 
and Language Index,1 including poverty of speech and 
loosening of associations, where the connection between 
ideas is tenuous or extraneous ideas intrude into the 
train of thought.1 Several studies have highlighted the 
importance of FTD. A large longitudinal study showed 
loosening of associations in speech appeared early in the 
disorder, was present in the majority of cases, and did 
not resolve over 30 years of investigation.2 More gen-
erally, FTD has been related to more severe forms of

psychosis,3,4 lower quality of life5 and has been suggested 
to predict functional outcomes and relapse.6
The advent of natural language processing (NLP) 
techniques has provided new computational approaches 
to measure disorganized speech and FTD.7–17 These ap-
proaches can be applied automatically by computers 
and are therefore substantially less time-consuming than 
manual assessments using the TLI. For example,13 created 
networks to measure disorganized speech, in which nodes 
were represented as words, and edges connected words 
in the order in which they were spoken. These word-
trajectory networks showed patient-control differences 
in speech and predicted diagnosis 6 months in advance.11
However, these networks focus on the syntactic char-
acteristics of speech and largely ignore semantic content. 
Meanwhile, semantic abnormalities are a key feature of 
FTD.18–21 Measuring semantic coherence has been found 
to predict psychotic disorders,8,22 but this provides only 
a few summary measures of semantic speech content. 
Speech excerpts likely include additional semantic in-
formation that could be used to build a deeper under-
standing of how the semantic content of language is 
altered in schizophrenia; and provide extra power to mon-
itor outcome or relapse for individual patients. Networks 
provide a natural way to represent the semantic content 
of a speech transcript in more detail, building on the idea 
that “reality is knowable as a set of informational units 
and relations among them.”23,24 Hence, it is plausible that 
representing the semantic content of speech as a net-
work could shed fresh light on the nature of speech in 
psychosis.
We, therefore, developed a novel speech network al-
gorithm that maps the semantic content of transcribed 
speech, creating semantic speech networks. These se-
mantic speech networks provide a natural framework to 
capture the information conveyed by the speaker by rep-
resenting the entities (eg, a person, object, or color) the 
speaker mentions as nodes and the relationships between 
entities as edges in the network. While we term these net-
works semantic speech networks, we note that grammar 
plays a key role in generating these networks: Our novel 
algorithm uses the grammatical structure of the text 
along with the semantic content of the words to repre-
sent the semantic relations conveyed through grammar 
and semantics as a network. We can then test whether 
the properties of these networks and relationships are 
related to particular properties of FTD, such as speech 
fragmentation and loosening of associations. Because the 
semantic speech networks represent how ideas are gram-
matically connected in the shape of referential and pred-
icative expressions, fragmentation of the semantic speech 
networks might reflect abnormalities in this connecting 
mechanism. Here we focus on speech fragmentation, al-
though we note that the networks created by Netts could 
also be used to study other aspects of FTD, for example, 
anaphoric referential structure over time. We are releasing 
the tool as an openly available Python package named 
Networks of Transcribed Speech in Python (netts) along-
side this article. The tool can be installed from PyPI25 and 
used to construct a semantic speech network from a text 
file with a single command.
In the following, we introduce netts and outline the 
processing steps the algorithm takes to construct a se-
mantic speech network from transcribed speech. We then 
describe results from applying netts to speech transcripts 
from a general population sample, where we explored 
the general properties of semantic speech networks and 
compared them with random networks. We also used the 
tool to test for group differences between semantic speech 
networks of first episode psychosis patients, individuals 
at clinical high risk for psychosis, and healthy controls. 
Finally, we explore the relationships of the semantic 
speech network measures with symptom severity, manual 
Thought and Language Index scores and with other es-
tablished NLP markers.
Methods
Network Algorithm
To construct semantic speech networks we created netts. 
Netts takes as input a speech transcript (eg, I see a man) 
and outputs a semantic speech network, where nodes are 
entities (eg, I, man) and edges are relations between nodes 
(eg, see).
In the following, we describe the netts pipeline, illus-
trated in figure 1.
Preprocessing.  Netts first cleans the text by expanding 
common contractions (eg, I’m becomes I am), and re-
moving interjections (eg, Mh, Uhm) and any transcrip-
tion notes (eg, timestamps). Netts then uses the CoreNLP 
library to perform sentence splitting, tokenization, part 
of speech tagging, lemmatization, dependency parsing, 
and coreferencing on the transcript,26 using the default 
CoreNLP language model (for more details, see supple-
mentary note 1).
Finding Nodes and Edges.  Netts submits each sentence 
to OpenIE5 to extract relationships between entities in 
the sentence using OpenIE5 default settings.27,28 For ex-
ample, from the sentence I see a man we identify the re-
lation see between the entities I and a man. From these 
extracted relations, netts creates an initial list of network 
edges.
Next, netts uses the previously identified part of 
speech tags and dependency structure to extract addi-
tional edges defined by prepositions or adjectives: For 
instance, a man on the picture contains a preposition edge 
where the entity a man and the picture are linked by an 
edge labeled on. An example of an adjective edge is dark 
background, where dark and background are linked by an 
implicit is.

Refining Nodes and Edges.  After creating the edge list, 
netts uses the previously identified co-referencing struc-
ture to merge nodes that refer to the same entity. For ex-
ample, a man might be referred to by the pronoun he, or 
the synonym the guy. To ensure every entity is represented 
by a unique node, nodes referring to the same entity are 
merged by replacing them with the most representative 
node label (first mention of the entity that is a noun). In 
our example, he and the guy would be replaced by a man.
Node labels are then cleaned of superfluous words 
such as determiners, eg, replacing a man with man.
Constructing Network.   Finally, netts constructs a se-
mantic speech network from the edge list using the 
networkX library29 and the network is plotted. The 
networkX object and the network image are saved for 
later analysis. The resulting graphs are directed and 
unweighted.
An example semantic speech network is shown in 
figure 2.
Data
We applied netts to transcribed speech data from two 
studies: (1) a general population cohort (N = 436), col-
lected online, and (2) a clinical dataset including N = 16 
first episode psychosis (FEP) patients, N = 13 healthy 
control subjects and N = 24 subjects at clinical high risk 
of psychosis (CHR-P), collected in person (total N = 
53).30 CHR-P participants met the ultra high risk criteria 
from the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental 
States (CAARMS31). Controls had no history of psychi-
atric illness. Further recruitment and demographic details 
are given in supplementary note 2. This dataset has previ-
ously been used to investigate patient-control differences 
in established NLP measures, including the speech graph 
measures proposed by Mota et al,12,13 the results of which 
are reported in Morgan et al22 and Spencer et al.32 Here, 
we used this clinical dataset to investigate differences in 
our novel semantic speech network measures. We used 
the established NLP measures solely to contextualize the 
signal captured by the semantic speech networks.
In both studies, participants described ambiguous 
pictures from the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT33). 
Participants were presented with 8 pictures from the TAT 
and instructed to talk about each picture for 1 minute 
while audio was recorded.
In the clinical dataset, participants additionally per-
formed a story recall task, in which they were read 6 
stories from the Discourse Comprehension Test34 and 
asked to retell them with as many details as possible. In 
the following, we focus primarily on the picture descrip-
tion transcripts, which were available for both datasets, 
then assess whether we see similar clinical group differ-
ences in semantic networks with the story recall task.
The positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS35) 
was used to measure symptom severity. The Thought and 
Language Index (TLI1) was used to assess FTD.
The speech recordings were transcribed manually by a 
trained assessor, who was blinded to participant group 
status in the case of the clinical dataset.
All participants were fluent in English and gave written 
informed consent after receiving a complete descrip-
tion of the study. Ethical approval for the clinical study 
was obtained from the Institute of Psychiatry Research 
Ethics Committee, whilst ethical approval for the general 
population study was obtained from the King’s College 
London Research Ethics Committee.
Speech Measures
Netts Measures.  We constructed a semantic speech net-
work for each transcript using netts. Overall, netts took 
~40 seconds processing time per 1 minute speech tran-
script. We then calculated the number of nodes and edges. 
Fig. 1.  Netts processing pipeline. Netts takes as input a speech transcript and outputs a network representing the semantic content of the 
transcript: a semantic speech network. Netts combines modern, high performance NLP techniques to preprocess the speech transcript, 
find nodes and edges, refine these nodes and edges and construct the final semantic speech network.

Semantic Speech Networks in Early Psychosis
We also calculated the number of connected components 
in each network, alongside their mean and median size. 
Here, a connected component is a subgraph of the orig-
inal graph where all nodes are connected to each other by 
a path, ignoring edge directions. We decided to focus our 
analysis on connected components because when visual-
izing networks from the general population dataset it was 
clear the networks often contained multiple connected 
components. Prior work on syntactic speech graphs has 
also shown size of connected components can be infor-
mative for psychosis.12
All netts measures were compared to 1000 random 
Erdős–Rényi networks, matched for number of nodes 
and edges. The netts measures were then normalized to 
the random networks by z-scoring.
Additional NLP Measures.  We compared our semantic 
speech graph measures with other NLP approaches that 
previously showed significant group differences in the 
clinical dataset.22,32 Specifically, to contextualize the se-
mantic speech network measures, we calculated semantic 
coherence, tangentiality, on-topic score and ambiguous 
pronoun count, and connectivity measures from the syn-
tactic speech graphs proposed by Mota et al.11,12 In these 
syntactic speech graphs proposed by Mota et al, words are 
nodes and words spoken consecutively are connected by 
an edge. Supplementary figure 6 illustrates the difference 
between syntactic speech graphs and semantic speech 
networks derived from the same speech transcript: While 
in syntactic speech graphs11,12 each node is a word (eg, 
I, see, a, man) and words spoken in succession are con-
nected, semantic speech networks represent the content 
of speech where nodes are entities (eg, I, man) and edges 
are relations between nodes (eg, see, wears). Connectivity 
of the syntactic speech graphs is measured by calculating 
the total number of nodes in the largest connected com-
ponent (LCC) and the largest strongly connected compo-
nent (LSC)11,12 (for a detailed description of the syntactic 
graph measures as well as the other additional NLP 
measures, see supplementary note 3).
Statistical Analysis
All measures were calculated for each transcript from 
each participant. To obtain a single value per participant, 
we calculated the mean average across the eight TAT pic-
ture descriptions.
We assessed the normality of the measures using the 
Shapiro-Wilk test. Because some measures were not nor-
mally distributed and to mitigate the presence of poten-
tial outliers, we used the Mann-Whitney U-test to test for 
group differences (see supplementary table 1).
Fig. 2.  Example speech network. Semantic speech networks map the semantic content of transcribed speech engendered by the 
grammatical structure. Nodes in the network represent entities mentioned by the speaker (eg, I, man). Edges represent relations between 
nodes mentioned by the speaker (eg, see). Top left figure inset shows the stimulus picture that the participant described. Top right figure 
inset is the speech transcript.

To explore the relationship between the netts meas-
ures and other speech measures, we calculated Pearson’s 
correlation coefficients between all measures. The re-
sulting correlation matrix was clustered using the popular 
Louvain method for community detection.36
Finally, we investigated the relationships between the 
netts measures and symptom and TLI scores, using linear 
regression, controlling for group membership as covariates.
Results
General Public Networks
We first constructed semantic speech networks from the 
2861 speech transcripts obtained from 436 members of 
the general public. 16 of the resulting networks were 
empty and therefore excluded from further analysis. Our 
final general public sample, therefore, consisted of 2845 
networks. The resulting semantic speech networks con-
sisted of 15.77 ± 5.03 nodes and 15.04 ± 5.61 edges on 
average; see figure 3.
Speech Networks Had Fewer and Larger Components 
Than Random Networks
Compared to size-matched random networks, the speech 
networks had fewer connected components (t =−28.51, 
P = < .00001, Mean ± Std: −0.55 ± 0.41); see figure 3. 
These connected components were also significantly 
larger than the connected components of size-matched 
random networks (Mean: t = 23.19, P = < .00001; 
Median: t = 35.0, P = < .00001; figure 3).
Networks in the Clinical Dataset
The clinical dataset consisted of 415 transcripts. FEP pa-
tients spoke trendwise fewer words and more sentences 
than controls, resulting in shorter sentences (words: 
z = 1.73, P = .08; sentences: z = −2.39, P = .02, mean 
sentence length: z = 2.83, P < .01).
There was no difference in the number of words or sen-
tences between CHR-P participants and either FEP pa-
tients or controls (all P > .12).

speech graphs (blue bars) and a randomly chosen subset of the size-matched random graphs (gray bars). Bottom row shows normalized

Semantic Speech Networks in Early Psychosis
Patient Networks Were Smaller
Differences in the amount of speech were reflected in the 
semantic speech networks. FEP networks had fewer nodes 
(z = 2.33, P = .02) and fewer edges (z = 1.97, P = .048) 
than healthy control networks. Numbers of nodes and 
edges did not differ between CHR-P participants and ei-
ther FEP patients or controls (all P > .13). Representative 
FEP patient and control networks are shown in figures 
4D and 4E.
Patient Networks Had More and Smaller Components
The normalized number of connected components was 
higher for FEP patient networks than healthy control 
networks (z = −2.00, P = .046; figure 4A). FEP patients 
also had a trendwise higher number of connected compo-
nents than CHR-P participants (z = 1.81, P = .07). There 
was no significant difference in the normalized number of 
connected components between CHR-P participants and 
controls (z = −0.79, P = .43)).
Mean connected component size was trendwise smaller 
for FEP patients than healthy controls (z = 1.73, P = .08; 
figure 4B) and smaller for FEP patients than CHR-P 
participants (z = −2.01, P = .04). There was no signif-
icant difference in mean connected component size be-
tween CHR-P participants and healthy controls (z = 0.13, 
P = .90).
We also calculated the median connected component 
size, which should be less influenced than mean size by 
the 1 or 2 very large connected components speech net-
works often contain. The median connected component 
size should hence give a better indication of the size dis-
tribution of connected components. Both FEP patients 
and CHR-P participants had significantly smaller me-
dian connected component size compared to controls 
(z = 2.70, P < .01 for FEPs, z = 2.14, P = .03 for CHR-P 
subjects; figure 4C). There was no difference in median 
connected component size between CHR-P participants 
and FEP patients (z = −1.16, P = .25).
Sensitivity and Reliability Analyses
Our normalization procedure controls for network size. 
However, to ensure that semantic speech networks cap-
ture signal over and above simple differences in the 
amount of speech, we performed an additional sensi-
tivity analysis testing whether the group differences in 
Fig. 4.  Clinical networks differ between groups. (A) Number of connected components, (B) mean connected component size, and (C) 
median connected component size showed differences between the FEP patient (FEP), clinical high risk (CHR-P), and healthy control 
groups (CON). Network measures shown are normalized to random networks. Each datapoint represents one subject. Values were 
obtained by averaging across network measures from the eight TAT picture descriptions. * indicates significant p-values at P < .05. **

the networks of healthy controls. D shows a typical network from a healthy control participant and E shows a typical network from a 
first episode psychosis patient. Plots A–C were produced using the Raincloud package37and D–E using networkX.29.

semantic speech network measures remained significant 
when controlling for number of words. To that end, we 
constructed a linear model of the network measure as a 
function of group and included number of words as a 
covariate.
The FEP patient-control difference in number of con-
nected components remained significant after control-
ling for number of words (Significant overall regression 
model: F(3, 48) = 3.33, P = .03, with significant effect of 
patient: β = 0.24, P = .04), as did the FEP patient-control 
difference in the median size of connected components 
(Significant overall regression model: F(3, 48) = 4.868, P 
< .01, with significant effect of patient: β = −0.51, P = 
.01). The difference in median size of connected compo-
nents between CHR-P participants and healthy controls 
did not survive controlling for number of words (no sig-
nificant effect of CHR-P participant: β = −0.29, P = .12). 
There was no significant group difference between FEP, 
CON and CHR-P networks in mean size of connected 
components after controlling for number of words (F(3, 
48) = 1.97, P = .13).
We also performed additional sensitivity analyses con-
trolling for mean sentence length which showed a similar 
pattern to the analyses controlling for number of words 
and can be found in supplementary note 6.
Since these NLP measures are novel and clinical imple-
mentation hinges on appropriate reliability, we probed the 
reliability of our network measures within subjects. For 
this, we calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient 
(ICC) of the main variables of interest across all subjects 
in the clinical dataset, excluding 1 participant who had 
no speech excerpt for TAT picture 8. Both number of 
connected components and mean size of connected 
components had a significant intraclass correlation (CC 
Number: ICC = 0.14, F(50,350) = 2.29; P < .00001; CC 
Mean Size: ICC = 0.08, F(50,350) = 1.69; P < .01), while 
the median number of connected components showed a 
trendwise significant intraclass correlation of ICC = 0.04, 
F(50,350) = 1.37; P = .058). These results indicate that 
the semantic speech network measures assessed were rela-
tively consistent within subjects of the clinical sample. We 
also calculated the ICC for the general public networks 
and found that all variables of interest had a highly sig-
nificant intraclass correlation (CC Number: ICC = 0.10, 
F(274,1918) = 1.93; P < .0001; CC Mean Size: ICC = 
0.07, F(274,1918) = 1.57; P < .0001; CC Median Size: 
ICC = 0.12, F(274,1918) = 2.05, P < .0001).
Semantic Speech Networks May Capture Novel 
Information
Figure 5 shows a heatmap of the correlations between 
the semantic speech network measures and other NLP 
measures, calculated using the clinical dataset. The black 
lines denote communities detected using the Louvain 
method.36
As expected, the number of nodes and number of 
edges of the semantic speech networks clustered with the 
number of words in the transcript. The connected compo-
nent measures (CC Number, CC Median Size, CC Mean 
Size) formed their own community and did not cluster 
with number of words, number of sentences, measures of 
network size, or any other NLP measures.
Component Size Was Associated With TLI Scores
Supplementary table 2 shows the relationships of the 
network measures with the PANSS symptom scores and 
the TLI. Median connected component size was nega-
tively related to TLI Negative scores (t = −2.02, P = .049, 
standardized β = −0.29). The number of connected com-
ponents and the mean size of connected components pre-
dicted PANSS Negative scores (CC Number: t = −2.55, 
P = .02, standardized β = 0.54; CC Mean Size: t = −2.12, 
P = .046, standardized β = −0.47), with participants scoring 
higher on the PANSS Negative scale having more and 
smaller connected components. However, none of these 
relationships survived Bonferroni-correction (significance 
threshold corrected for 6 × 3 comparisons: P = .0028).
Inspecting the TLI subscales, we observed a relation-
ship between median connected component size and 
poverty of speech (t = −2.33, P = .02, standardized 
β = −0.34; supplementary table 3). Number of con-
nected components and mean connected component 
size were related to peculiar logic (CC Number: t = 2.6, 
P = .01, standardized β = 0.37; CC Mean Size: t = −2.09, 
P = .04, standardized β = −0.30). However, none of 
these relationships survived Bonferroni-correction (sig-
nificance threshold corrected for 7  ×  3 comparisons: 
P = .0024). After poverty of speech, median component 
size was most strongly associated with looseness of asso-
ciations, although not significantly (t = −1.45, P = .15; 
standardized β = −0.22).
Story Networks Show Differences in Size between 
CHR-P participants and Healthy Controls, But Not in 
Connected Components
Finally, we assessed the task dependency of our results 
using speech generated from a story recall task.
Although number of words and number of sentences 
did not differ between FEP patients and healthy con-
trols (words: z = 1.46, P = .15, sentences: −1.18, P = .24), 
FEP patients showed reduced sentence length (z = 2.56, 
P = .01). FEP patients also showed reduced mean sen-
tence length compared to CHR-P participants (z = −2.58, 
P < .01). FEP patients spoke fewer words than CHR-P 
participants (z = −2.16, P = .03), but did not differ in 
number of sentences (z = 0.7, P = .49). There was no dif-
ference in the number of words and sentences or mean 
sentence length between CHR-P participants and con-
trols (all P > .37).

Semantic Speech Networks in Early Psychosis
This difference between FEP patients and CHR-P 
participants in the amount of speech was reflected in 
the semantic speech networks. FEP patient networks 
consisted of fewer nodes (z = −2.44, P = .01) and 
fewer edges (z = −2.9, P < .01) than CHR-P networks. 
Network size did not differ between healthy controls 
and either FEP patients or CHR-P participants (all 
P > .1), although there was a trendwise difference in the 
number of edges between controls and FEP patients 
(z = 1.87, P = .06).
The normalized number of connected components did 
not differ between groups (all P > .18). We also found no 
significant group differences in the mean and median size 
of the connected components (all P > .25).
Finally, in a post-hoc analysis to compare the char-
acteristics of the story recall and picture description 
networks, we calculated the ratio of edges to nodes for 
all networks. The semantic networks from the story 
re-telling task had significantly more edges per node 
than those from the picture description task (t = −11.87, 
P < .0001).
Discussion
We developed a novel algorithm, and software package, 
“netts” to map the semantic content of a speech tran-
script as a network, and investigate the nature of se-
mantic speech networks in psychosis.
Netts maps the content of speech as semantic speech 
networks by (1) identifying the entities described in a 
speech transcript (the nodes, frequently nouns), (2) ex-
tracting the semantic relationships between entities (the 
edges), and (3) plotting the resulting graph. This ap-
proach has several advantages. First, relationships be-
tween entities can be extracted from relatively distant 
parts of the transcript. The tool is also computationally 
fast, and robust against artifacts typical for transcribed 
speech, such as interjections (Um, Ah, Err) and word re-
petitions (I think the the man). The algorithm, therefore, 
lends itself to the automated construction of speech net-
works from large datasets.
Having developed the tool, we initially applied it to 
speech transcripts from the general population. The 
Fig. 5.  Clustered speech measures. Semantic speech network measures captured signal complementary to other NLP measures. Shown 
is a heatmap of Pearson’s correlations between semantic speech network measures and NLP measures in the clinical dataset. Black lines 
indicate communities detected using the Louvain method. The measures used in this analysis were the novel netts measures, as well as 
basic transcript measures and established NLP measures. Netts measures were number of connected components (CC Number), mean 
connected component size (CC Mean Size), and median connected component size (CC Median Size). Basic transcript measures were 
number of words, number of sentences, and mean sentence length. Established NLP measures included Tangentiality, Ambiguous 
Pronouns, Semantic Coherence (Coherence), On-Topic Score (On Topic) taken from Morgan et al.22 Additionally, syntactic network 
measures based on the method proposed by Mota et al,11,12 were taken from Morgan et al22 and included number of nodes in the largest 
strongly connected component of syntactic networks (LSC), number of nodes in the largest weakly connected component of syntactic 
networks (LCC), as well as the LSC and LCC normalized to random networks (LSCr, LCCr).12 Pearson's correlations were calculated 
from each subject's average NLP value. Values were obtained for each measure by averaging across values calculated from the eight TAT 
picture descriptions.

networks had fewer and larger connected components 
than size-matched random Erdős–Rényi networks. This 
distinction from random networks reflects the nature 
of semantic speech networks, and the fact that when 
describing the picture people tend to link different 
aspects of the picture together in a way that is intrinsi-
cally nonrandom. These results imply that netts is capable 
of extracting a substantial number of nodes and edges 
from a short transcript based on identifying entities and 
semantic relations in the speech transcript - a non-trivial 
task for current NLP tools that are primarily trained on 
text that is very unlike speech (eg, newspaper articles).
In our clinical sample, semantic speech networks from 
FEP patients had fewer nodes and number of edges than 
those from healthy controls for the picture description, 
but only trendwise differences in edges for the story recall 
task. CHR-P subjects had more nodes and edges than 
FEP patients for the story recall task, but not the picture 
description task. These observations are in-line with the 
group differences in the number of words spoken, and 
poverty of speech in psychosis.
We also explored whether there were group differ-
ences in the number and size of the networks’ connected 
components, motivated by the loosening of associations 
often observed in FEP. In the picture description task, 
FEP patient networks were more fragmented than con-
trol networks, with more, smaller connected components. 
The semantic speech networks generated by netts map 
referential elements to entities mentioned by the speaker 
and derives links between the entities based on grammat-
ical structure. Fragmentation of the networks of patients 
could be the result of an abnormal connecting mech-
anism in patient speech compared with controls. The pre-
cise nature of this connecting mechanism and how it is 
altered in patients could be investigated in future research 
using the semantic speech networks generated by netts.
Relationships between the network connectivity meas-
ures and the TLI and PANSS scores were strongest for 
the negative TLI and negative PANSS scores, but did 
not survive correction for multiple comparisons. We 
note that a large majority of participants scored zero for 
TLI Negative (71%), peculiar logic (86%) and poverty of 
speech (75%), suggesting that a flooring effect could be 
obscuring significant relationships. Interestingly, after 
poverty of speech, median component size was most 
strongly associated with looseness of associations. This 
relationship did not reach significance, though here again 
a flooring effect might be obscuring a significant relation-
ship because 80% of participants in the clinical dataset 
scored zero for looseness of associations. We note, how-
ever, that there were significant group differences in the 
TLI scores in this sample, specifically in the TLI Total 
(P = .0029, table 1 in Morgan et al22) and the TLI Positive 
scale (P < .001; table 1 in Morgan et al22)
The increased fragmentation in FEP patient networks 
compared to controls was not observed with the story 
recall task. This could be a result of the differing cogni-
tive demands of the two tasks and the probing of distinct 
mental processes. For example, story re-telling relies on 
working memory, but does not require the participants to 
spontaneously connect entities with each other, unlike the 
picture description task. We note that semantic speech 
graphs from the story recall task also had more edges per 
node than those from the picture description task, again 
likely reflecting the more structured nature of the recalled 
stories compared to spontaneous speech. Hence, the pic-
ture description task may be much more suited to bringing 
about “disconnected” or “fragmented” descriptions than 
the story recall task. However, we cannot exclude the pos-
sibility that the picture description task showing group 
differences and the story recall task not showing differ-
ences could be due to a type I or type II error. In light of 
this, these results should be interpreted cautiously when 
generalizing to other tasks and further work is required 
to fully understand these task dependencies, ideally with 
larger sample sizes. Nonetheless, our results again suggest 
the need for careful consideration of the choice of tasks 
to elicit speech responses from participants.12,22
As expected, in a clustering analysis, the number of 
nodes and edges in the semantic speech networks are 
clustered with the number of words. The number and size 
of connected components formed their own community, 
independent of previously reported NLP measures22 in-
cluding syntactic graph measures11 and semantic coher-
ence. The connected components in semantic speech 
networks might therefore capture signal beyond the in-
formation contained in established NLP measures or re-
lating to the amount of speech.
Overall, netts allows us to map the semantic content of 
speech as a network, opening the door to more detailed 
analyses of the semantic content of speech, and how this 
is altered in FTD. Measures of network size and connec-
tivity showed significant group differences between FEP 
patients, CHR-P subjects and healthy controls and pro-
vided complementary information to established NLP 
measures. We hope that the open availability of netts will 
allow other researchers to explore this new perspective on 
how disorganized speech is manifest in psychosis.
Limitations
We examined relatively basic topological properties of se-
mantic speech networks, eg, size and number of connected 
components. Nonetheless, semantic speech networks 
also include additional information. For example, netts 
records temporal information about the order in which 
edges were formed in the networks, which could be used 
to give an indication of network coherence or staying on 
topic. Furthermore, the edges include context informa-
tion on epistemic uncertainty (eg, “She does not seem,” 
“I would imagine,” “It could be,” “You could say”) and 
about whether relationships between entities are negated

Semantic Speech Networks in Early Psychosis
(eg, “She is not tall” would result in an edge labeled as 
negated between “She” and “tall”) which could be util-
ized. The words associated with nodes and edges could 
also be represented as vectors using word embedding 
methods, to provide rich node labels. These more ad-
vanced network features could provide additional power 
for deep phenotyping of psychotic disorders.
Preprocessing in netts includes sentence splitting 
based on punctuation. The text excerpts used in this 
study were transcribed manually, and therefore sentence 
splitting is based on punctuation by human annotators. 
We cannot exclude the possibility that fully automated 
sentence splitting would affect the generated semantic 
speech networks. Netts is currently only available for the 
English language and would need to be adapted for use 
with other languages. The term “formal thought dis-
order” infers alterations in speech are a result of altered 
thinking. We used the term “formal thought disorder” 
here to refer to alterations in speech that are evident 
in patients with psychosis, as it is widely used in this 
manner, but we note the distinction between thought and 
language. We note also that the TAT involves subjects 
speaking in response to a series of pictures. As such, it 
does not elicit true discourse, as in a free speech par-
adigm. Furthermore, although our sensitivity analyses 
controlling for potential confounds (number of words 
and mean sentence length) concluded that the overall 
pattern of patient-control differences was robust, we 
cannot rule out the possibility that group differences in 
the semantic speech network measures might be driven 
by other potentially confounding factors.
Finally, the modest sample size of this study, though 
similar to those used in previous studies is unlikely to fully 
capture the diverse phenotype of psychosis38 and the het-
erogeneity of CHR-P subjects. It is therefore crucial for 
future studies to test the generalizability and the clinical 
validity of these results. Generating semantic speech net-
works for larger clinical samples will also be important to 
assess whether netts provides additional predictive power 
beyond existing NLP measures and to fully validate the 
relationship between semantic speech network measures 
and FTD, as measured by the TLI for example. We be-
lieve the main contribution of netts is that it provides a 
new framework in which semantic relationships can be 
mapped as a network. Although we show that features 
extracted from these networks can differentiate patients 
from controls, it will take time to develop clinical transla-
tion. To support further research into the clinical relevance 
of netts, we are releasing netts as a free and open-source 
Python package alongside this article. The netts toolbox is 
available at: https://pypi.org/project/netts/.
