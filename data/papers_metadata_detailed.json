Demonstrating this relationship is critical if we expect speech and communication deficits to emerge as targets for early intervention. We analyzed three 1-min speech samples using automated speech analysis and Bayes networks in an antipsychotic-naive sample of 39 FEP patients and followed them longi"

Limited pieces of evidence and neuroimaging studies indicate they differ from patients with non-deficit schizophrenia (SZND) in neurobiological aspects, but the results are far from conclusive. We applied for the first time, graph theory analyses to discriminate local and global indices of brain network topology in SZD and SZND patients compared with healthy controls (HC).

For example, \"concept\" has different meanings in philosophy, linguistics, and psychology. As such, many fundamental constructs used to delineate semantic theories remain underspecified and/or op"
