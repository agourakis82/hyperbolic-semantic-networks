abstract: |
  Semantic networks, representing word associations, exhibit complex topological
  properties. This study provides cross-linguistic evidence that semantic networks
  universally exhibit hyperbolic geometry (negative Ricci curvature), independent
  of language family. Analysis of word association data from four languages
  (Spanish, Dutch, Chinese, English) shows consistent negative mean curvature
  (κ = -0.166 ± 0.042), with all networks exhibiting scale-free topology.
  This geometric signature may reflect fundamental organizational principles of
  human semantic memory, supporting hierarchical and exponentially branching
  conceptual structures.
