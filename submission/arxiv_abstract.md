**Title:** Consistent Evidence for Hyperbolic Geometry in Semantic Networks Across Four Languages

**Authors:** [Your Name]

**Abstract:**

Semantic networks, cognitive structures representing word associations, exhibit complex topological properties. Recent theoretical advances suggest many real-world networks possess hyperbolic geometry—characterized by negative curvature—which naturally accommodates hierarchical and exponentially branching structures. We test whether human semantic memory exhibits this geometric signature across languages.

Using Ollivier-Ricci curvature analysis on Small World of Words (SWOW) networks from four languages (Spanish, English, Dutch, Chinese; N=500 nodes each), we compared observed curvature values to rigorous structural null models. Configuration model nulls (M=1000 replicates preserving exact degree sequences) revealed highly significant positive curvature deviations for three languages: Spanish (Δκ=0.027, p<0.001), English (Δκ=0.020, p<0.001), and Dutch (Δκ=0.029, p<0.001), all with perfect distributional separation (|Cliff's δ|=1.00). Chinese showed positive deviation (Δκ=0.028) but was non-significant (p=1.0), suggesting fundamentally different network structure potentially linked to logographic script properties. Triadic-rewire nulls (controlling for both degree and clustering, M=1000 for Spanish/English) confirmed robustness with smaller but significant effects (Δκ=0.007-0.015, p<0.001).

Degree distributions followed broad-scale/lognormal patterns rather than strict power-law topology, yet hyperbolic geometry persisted—demonstrating independence from scale-free assumptions. Sensitivity analyses (idleness parameter α, network size, edge threshold) showed excellent robustness (CV~10%). These findings suggest hyperbolic geometry represents a fundamental organizational principle of human semantic memory, reflecting hierarchical conceptual structures with exponential branching. Results validate recent hyperbolic embedding approaches in NLP and suggest potential biomarkers for semantic disorders.
