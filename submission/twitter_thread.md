### **Tweet 1/7** (Hook)
🧠 NEW PREPRINT: Do semantic networks in our minds have hyperbolic geometry?

We analyzed word association networks across 4 languages and found consistent evidence for intrinsic hyperbolic structure—the same geometry that efficiently represents hierarchies.

Paper: [arXiv link]
Code: github.com/agourakis82/hyperbolic-semantic-networks

### **Tweet 2/7** (Problem & Method)
Semantic memory (how we organize word meanings) is often modeled as networks. But what's their geometric signature?

We used Ricci curvature—a geometric tool from physics—to measure "curvature" of semantic networks from Spanish, English, Dutch & Chinese word associations (SWOW data, N=500 words each).

---

### **Tweet 3/7** (Key Finding)
📊 RESULT: 3/4 languages showed significantly negative curvature (hyperbolic geometry):
• Spanish: Δκ=0.027, p<0.001
• English: Δκ=0.020, p<0.001  
• Dutch: Δκ=0.029, p<0.001

Effect sizes were HUGE (|Cliff's δ|=1.00 = perfect separation from nulls).

Chinese was different—more on that below...

### **Tweet 4/7** (Methodological Innovation)
🔬 Why this matters methodologically:

We used **structural null models** (configuration model, M=1000) that match EXACT degree distributions. This rules out "it's just hubs!" explanations.

We also ran triadic nulls (preserve clustering). Still significant.

This is way more rigorous than past ER/BA comparisons.

### **Tweet 5/7** (Chinese Anomaly)
🇨🇳 Chinese network puzzle:

While Spanish/English/Dutch showed κ < -0.15 (strongly hyperbolic), Chinese showed κ ≈ 0 (flat!).

Hypothesis: Logographic characters (meaning-direct) may create fundamentally different associative structure than alphabetic scripts (meaning+phonology).

Needs more research!

### **Tweet 6/7** (Implications)
💡 WHY THIS MATTERS:

1) Validates hyperbolic embeddings in NLP (turns out real semantic networks ARE hyperbolic!)
2) Supports hierarchical theories of semantic memory
3) May enable biomarkers for semantic disorders (Alzheimer's, aphasia)
4) Challenges scale-free assumptions (works with broad-scale networks too)
