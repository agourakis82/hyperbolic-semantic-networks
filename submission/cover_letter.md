Dear Editors of *Nature Communications*,

I am pleased to submit the manuscript entitled **"Boundary Conditions for Hyperbolic Geometry in Semantic Networks: Clustering-Curvature Trade-offs Revealed by Ollivier-Ricci Analysis"**, which identifies the quantitative balance of clustering and degree heterogeneity that gives rise to hyperbolic geometry in semantic association networks across eight semantic graphs spanning three language families.

## **Why This Work Matters**

Semantic networks—cognitive structures representing word associations—are frequently assumed to be hyperbolic, yet the geometric boundary conditions that support negative curvature have remained unclear. Using **Ollivier–Ricci curvature** on directed weighted graphs (SWOW, ConceptNet, and taxonomy data) and matching **configuration and triadic-rewire null models**, we demonstrate that hyperbolicity is **not universal** but confined to a **moderate-clustering regime (C ≈ 0.02–0.15)**. This "hyperbolic sweet spot" unites linguistic, cognitive, and clinical evidence: association networks of healthy cognition occupy this region, whereas pathological language (schizophrenia, depression, mania) deviates toward Euclidean or spherical extremes.

## **Novel Contributions**

**First, boundary conditions for hyperbolic geometry.** We show that semantic networks exhibit negative curvature only when topology satisfies specific balance conditions: moderate clustering (C ≈ 0.02–0.15), heavy-tailed degree distributions (broad-scale rather than strictly scale-free), and a mixture of primary and context-driven associations. This structural balance yields an operational criterion for future analyses.

**Second, causal inference via structural null models.** Configuration model nulls (M = 1000 replicates) that preserved degree distributions but destroyed clustering proved significantly more hyperbolic than real networks (Δκ = +0.17 to +0.22, p_MC < 0.001), confirming that local clustering moderates underlying geometry. Triadic-rewire nulls (M = 1000, Spanish and English) preserved triangle counts and eliminated the curvature shift, isolating clustering as the causal moderator.

**Third, functional resistance to geometric smoothing.** Discrete Ricci flow experiments demonstrated that forcing semantic graphs toward curvature equilibrium reduces clustering by 79–86% and removes negative curvature, yet real networks resist full flattening. This "resistance to Ricci flow" suggests functional optimization (efficient navigation, inferential cost) versus geometric smoothing.

**Fourth, cross-linguistic and cross-domain replication.** Our results establish consistency across eight semantic graphs (three SWOW association networks, two ConceptNet knowledge graphs, and three taxonomy-based lexicons) spanning Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, and Semitic language families. This cross-linguistic scope strengthens generalizability while highlighting important structural variation.

## **Fit with Nature Communications**

This manuscript aligns perfectly with *Nature Communications*' scope, combining rigorous network analysis, cognitive science applications, and methodological innovation. The structural null model approach addresses recent methodological debates in network science, while the cross-linguistic cognitive focus connects to the journal's interdisciplinary mission. Our findings have implications for network geometry theory, cognitive network modeling, computational linguistics, and clinical biomarkers for semantic disorders.

## **Transparency and Reproducibility**

All data come from publicly available sources (SWOW at https://smallworldofwords.org, ConceptNet, WordNet, BabelNet), and complete analysis code is available on GitHub with DOI (10.5281/zenodo.17531773). We provide comprehensive sensitivity analyses, bootstrap confidence intervals, and detailed methodological transparency throughout. The manuscript includes explicit computational limitations (triadic-rewire nulls completed for 2/8 networks due to computational cost) and power analysis recommendations.

## **Significance**

If semantic memory's fundamental geometry is hyperbolic within specific boundary conditions, this has theoretical implications for hierarchical memory models, validates hyperbolic embedding approaches in NLP, and suggests novel biomarkers for semantic disorders where network geometry might be disrupted. The finding that geometry persists independently of strict scale-free topology advances network geometry theory more broadly.
