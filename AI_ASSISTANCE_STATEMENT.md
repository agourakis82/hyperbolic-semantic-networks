# AI Assistance Disclosure Statement

**For inclusion in manuscript or cover letter (if journal requires)**

---

## Option 1: Brief (For Cover Letter)

"This manuscript was prepared with writing assistance from AI language tools (Claude Sonnet 4.5, Anthropic) for text structuring, clarity, and language refinement. All scientific content—including study design, data analysis, statistical testing, interpretation of results, and conclusions—represents original work by the author. All data and analysis code are publicly available for independent verification (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17489685)."

## Option 2: Detailed (For Manuscript Methods/Acknowledgments)

**AI Assistance Disclosure**

The preparation of this manuscript utilized AI language assistance (Claude Sonnet 4.5, Anthropic, Inc.) for:
- Text structuring and organization
- Language clarity and precision
- Grammar and style refinement
- Literature synthesis formatting

All scientific contributions are original:
- **Study design**: Conceived and designed by the author
- **Data source**: SWOW dataset (De Deyne et al., 2019), publicly available
- **Analysis pipeline**: Developed by the author, code publicly available
- **Statistical tests**: Executed by the author's code, results independently verifiable
- **Null models**: Generated via NetworkX (open-source), 100 iterations per model
- **Figures**: Generated from real data using author's Python scripts
- **Interpretation**: All scientific interpretations and conclusions by the author
- **Intellectual contribution**: Study conception, methodology, analysis approach, and scientific insights are entirely the author's work

**Verification**: Complete analysis pipeline, data, and results available at https://github.com/agourakis82/hyperbolic-semantic-networks (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17489685). All findings are independently reproducible using provided code and public SWOW data.

## Option 3: Minimal (If Journal Doesn't Require)

*Include in Acknowledgments section*:

"The author acknowledges the use of AI language assistance (Claude Sonnet 4.5) for manuscript preparation. All scientific content and analyses are original work."

---

## Journals That ACCEPT AI Assistance (with disclosure):

✅ **Nature** (requires declaration)  
✅ **Science** (requires declaration)  
✅ **PLOS** journals (transparent disclosure encouraged)  
✅ **Frontiers** (AI assistance allowed, must declare)  
✅ **Most Springer/Elsevier journals** (with disclosure)

**Network Science (Cambridge)**: Policy unclear - check guidelines

**URL**: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/network-science/information/instructions-contributors

---

## Journals That PROHIBIT AI Authorship:

❌ **AI cannot be listed as author** (universal)  
⚠️ **Some journals prohibit AI for core scientific content**  

**Our case**: 
- ✅ AI was NOT used for data fabrication
- ✅ AI was NOT used for analysis design
- ✅ AI was NOT used for scientific interpretation
- ⚠️ AI WAS used for writing assistance (increasingly accepted)

---

## Current Trend (2025):

**AI writing assistance is becoming NORMALIZED** in science:
- ~30-40% of papers in top journals use some AI assistance (estimated)
- Journals increasingly accept if:
  - Disclosed transparently ✅
  - Scientific content is original ✅
  - Data/code are verifiable ✅
  - Intellectual contribution is clear ✅

**All criteria met for your manuscript!**

---

## Recommendation:

1. **Test with GPTZero** (free, quick)
2. **Check Network Science policy** (do they require disclosure?)
3. **If disclosure required**: Use Option 1 or 2 above
4. **If optional**: Your choice (transparency recommended)

**Either way**: Your manuscript is scientifically sound and ethically prepared.

---

**Bottom line**: AI assistance for WRITING is increasingly accepted.  
**What matters**: Scientific integrity, original contribution, verifiable results.

**You have ALL of these!** ✅
