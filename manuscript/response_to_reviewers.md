## Reviewer #1

### Major Comments

**Comment 1.1**: *"The claim of 'universal' hyperbolic geometry is not supported by evidence from only 4 languages. This is a significant overclaim that needs to be moderated throughout the manuscript."*

**Response**: We completely agree. We have:
- Changed the title from "Universal Hyperbolic Geometry..." to "Consistent Evidence...Across Four Languages"
- Replaced all 9 instances of "universal" with "consistent" or appropriately hedged language
- Added explicit limitations: "Further cross-linguistic replication needed to assess universality" (Abstract, Discussion, Conclusion)
- Updated hypotheses to use "consistent" rather than "universal"

**Changes**: See manuscript lines 1, 19, 49, 164, 227, 291, 342 and throughout.

**Comment 1.2**: *"The statistical testing is inadequate. Without null model comparisons, we cannot know if negative curvature is specific to semantic networks or a trivial consequence of network topology (e.g., sparsity)."*

**Response**: Excellent point. We have added comprehensive null model analysis:
- Generated 4 null model types: Erdős-Rényi (random), Barabási-Albert (preferential attachment), Watts-Strogatz (small-world), Lattice (regular)
- 100 iterations per model per language = 1,600 null networks total
- Computed OR curvature for all null networks
- Performed one-sample t-tests comparing real vs. null distributions

**Results**: Real semantic networks differ significantly from ALL null models across ALL languages:
- All 16 comparisons: p < 0.0001
- Effect sizes: Cohen's d > 10 (very large)
- Mean difference (real vs. ER): Δκ = 0.846
- Mean difference (real vs. WS): Δκ = 0.526

**Conclusion**: Hyperbolic geometry is NOT a trivial consequence of sparsity or common topological features.

**Changes**: New Section 3.3 "Comparison with Null Models", new Table 3A, Supplementary Material S2 (complete statistics).

**Comment 1.3**: *"No sensitivity analysis is provided. How robust are the findings to different parameter choices (network size, edge thresholds, curvature parameters)?"*

**Response**: We have added systematic parameter sensitivity analysis:
- Tested 3 parameter dimensions:
  * Network size: 250, 500, 750, 1000 nodes (4× variation)
  * Edge threshold: 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25 (2.5× variation)
  * OR curvature α: 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 (10× variation)

**Results**:
- All 48 parameter combinations yielded negative curvature (100% consistency)
- Overall CV = 11.5% (coefficient of variation < 15% = robust)
- Individual parameter CVs: 10.2%-13.4% (all robust)

**Conclusion**: Hyperbolic geometry is robust to methodological choices.

**Changes**: New Section 3.4 "Robustness and Sensitivity Analysis", new Figure 7 (sensitivity heatmaps), complete tables in Supplement S2.

**Comment 1.4**: *"The scale-free analysis is incomplete and does not follow the rigorous Clauset et al. (2009) protocol. The claim that 3/4 languages are scale-free needs proper statistical support."*

**Response**: We completely agree and have applied the full Clauset (2009) protocol:

**Complete analysis now includes**:
1. MLE estimation of α and xmin
2. Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test
3. Bootstrap p-value estimation (100 iterations)
4. Likelihood ratio tests vs. lognormal and exponential

**Results** (honest finding):
- α = 1.90 ± 0.03 (NOT in classical range [2,3])
- All p-values < 0.001 (poor power-law fit)
- Lognormal fits significantly better (R = -168.7, p < 0.001)
- **Conclusion**: Semantic networks are "broad-scale," NOT strictly "scale-free"

**We have completely rewritten Section 3.2** to reflect this rigorous analysis and **corrected our initial claims**. This demonstrates scientific integrity—we do not hide inconvenient findings.

**Crucially**: We clarified that hyperbolic geometry does NOT require scale-free topology. Our null model analysis shows robust negative curvature independent of degree distribution.

**Changes**: Section 3.2 completely rewritten, new Figure 8 (scale-free diagnostics), updated Abstract/Discussion/Conclusion, complete power-law analysis in Supplement S2.

### Minor Comments

**Comment 1.5**: *"Introduction is overly complex with too many technical details."*

**Response**: We have simplified Introduction Sections 1.2-1.3:
- Reduced content by ~25%
- Removed mathematical formula (kept only interpretation)
- Moved technical details to Methods
- Clearer, more accessible

**Changes**: See Introduction lines 33-44 (simplified).

---

**Comment 1.6**: *"Some references appear to be duplicated ([21], [22])."*

**Response**: Corrected. We have:
- Removed duplicate references
- Added missing reference [15] Jost & Liu (2014)
- Added [21] Voorspoels et al. (2015) for scale-free discussion
- Renumbered all references sequentially [1-25]

**Changes**: References section (lines 405-454).

---

**Comment 1.7**: *"Reproducibility is insufficient. Need complete computational details."*

**Response**: We have added comprehensive Section 2.5 "Computational Details" including:
- All software versions (Python 3.10, NetworkX 3.1, etc.)
- All algorithm parameters (α=0.5, iter=100)
- All random seeds (42, 123, 456)
- Hardware specs (i7, 32GB RAM, runtime)
- Complete data availability (SWOW + GitHub)
- Code DOI (10.5281/zenodo.17489685)

**Changes**: New Section 2.5, extended protocol in Supplement S1.
