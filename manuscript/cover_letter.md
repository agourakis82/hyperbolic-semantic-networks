Dear Editors of *Nature Communications*,

I am pleased to submit the manuscript entitled **“Boundary Conditions for Hyperbolic Geometry in Semantic Networks”**, which identifies the quantitative balance of clustering and degree heterogeneity that gives rise to hyperbolic geometry in semantic association networks across four languages.

Using **Ollivier–Ricci curvature** on directed weighted graphs (eight semantic networks spanning three SWOW association networks, two ConceptNet knowledge graphs, and three taxonomy-based lexicons) and matching **configuration and triadic-rewire nulls**, we demonstrate that hyperbolicity is **not universal** but confined to a **moderate-clustering regime ($C \approx 0.02$–0.15)**. This "hyperbolic sweet spot" unites linguistic, cognitive, and clinical evidence: association networks of healthy cognition occupy this region, whereas pathological language (schizophrenia, depression, mania) deviates toward Euclidean or spherical extremes. Our rigorous analysis (Clauset et al. 2009 protocol) further reveals that semantic networks exhibit broad-scale rather than strictly scale-free topology, yet hyperbolic geometry emerges independently of specific degree distribution form.

The work contributes both methodologically—by integrating curvature-based geometry with classical network statistics—and conceptually, by providing boundary conditions for functional network geometry. All data and code are open (Zenodo DOI 10.5281/zenodo.17531773), ensuring full reproducibility.

We believe this manuscript will interest readers of *Nature Communications* across complex-systems science, cognitive neuroscience, and applied mathematics.

Sincerely,
