### 3.4 Comparison with Null Models

To assess whether the observed hyperbolic geometry arises from
specific network properties rather than generic topological features,
we compared real semantic networks against four null models:

1. **Erd≈ës-R√©nyi (ER)**: Random connectivity (p = m/n(n-1))
2. **Barab√°si-Albert (BA)**: Preferential attachment
3. **Watts-Strogatz (WS)**: Small-world rewiring
4. **Lattice**: Regular grid structure

For each model, we generated 100 instances matching the node count
and edge density of real networks, computed Ollivier-Ricci curvature,
and performed one-sample t-tests.

**Results** (Table 3): Real semantic networks exhibited significantly
more negative curvature than ALL null models across ALL languages
(p < 0.0001, Cohen's d > 10). This demonstrates that hyperbolic
geometry is not a generic feature of sparse networks, but reflects
specific semantic organization.

### PHASE 3: Add Sensitivity Analysis (DAY 3 - 2h)

#### New Section 3.5: "Robustness and Sensitivity"

**Content**:
```markdown
### 3.5 Robustness and Sensitivity Analysis

We tested robustness of hyperbolic geometry across three parameter dimensions:

1. **Network size**: 250, 500, 750, 1000 nodes
2. **Edge threshold**: Minimum weight 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25
3. **Alpha parameter**: OR curvature Œ± = 0.1-1.0

**Results** (Figure 7): Mean curvature remained negative across all
tested parameters (CV = 11.5%), demonstrating robust hyperbolic
geometry independent of sampling decisions.

[Insert Figure 7: Sensitivity heatmaps]
```

#### New Figure 7: Sensitivity Heatmaps
- 3 heatmaps (one per parameter)
- Show curvature values across parameter √ó language
- Color scale: more negative = more hyperbolic

### PHASE 4: Revise Scale-Free Claims (DAY 4 - 3h)

#### Section 3.3: "Degree Distribution Analysis"

**OLD TEXT**:
"All four languages exhibited scale-free topology (Œ± ‚àà [2,3])..."

**NEW TEXT**:
```markdown
We assessed degree distributions using the Clauset, Shalizi, Newman
(2009) protocol for power-law fitting. The estimated power-law
exponent was Œ± = 1.90 ¬± 0.03, falling below the classical scale-free
range [2,3]. Goodness-of-fit tests yielded poor p-values (all < 0.01),
and likelihood ratio tests favored lognormal over power-law
distributions (mean R = -168.7).

**Interpretation**: Semantic networks exhibit "broad-scale" rather
than strict scale-free topology. The degree distribution has a heavy
tail but does not follow a pure power law. This is consistent with
findings in other cognitive networks (Steyvers & Tenenbaum, 2005) and
may reflect constraints from semantic memory capacity.

Importantly, hyperbolic geometry does NOT require scale-free topology.
Our results demonstrate robust negative curvature independent of the
specific degree distribution (Section 3.5).
```

- Panel A: Log-log degree distribution + fits (power-law, lognormal, exponential)
- Panel B: Complementary CDF with fitted models
- Panel C: Likelihood ratio comparison (R values)

### PHASE 5: Update Discussion (DAY 5 - 2h)

#### Section 5.2: "Relationship to Network Topology"

**Add paragraph**:
```markdown
Our null model analysis (Section 3.4) demonstrates that hyperbolic
geometry is not a trivial consequence of network sparsity or common
topological features. Real semantic networks differed significantly
from random (ER), preferential attachment (BA), small-world (WS), and
regular (Lattice) null models (all p < 0.0001). This suggests that
hyperbolic geometry reflects specific organizational principles of
semantic memory.

Interestingly, we found broad-scale rather than strict scale-free
topology (Œ± = 1.90, lognormal fit superior). This contrasts with some
prior claims but aligns with recent re-analyses of cognitive networks
(Voorspoels et al., 2014). Crucially, hyperbolic geometry persisted
robustly across parameter variations (CV = 11.5%), demonstrating that
negative curvature is a fundamental property independent of specific
degree distribution assumptions.
```

#### Section 5.5: "Limitations"

**Add**:
- "Limited to 4 languages (3 language families)"
- "Future work: Broader cross-linguistic sampling"
- "Alternative curvature measures (e.g., Forman-Ricci)"
