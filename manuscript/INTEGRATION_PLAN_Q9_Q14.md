# Integration Plan – Queries Q9–Q14

## 1. Introduction Updates
- Expand Background with psychopatological SOTA (Q9) emphasizing fragmentation, mood-specific profiles, and TEA insights.
- Add subsection on recent Ricci curvature advances (Q10) to contextualize methodological novelty.

## 2. Methods Augmentation
- Detail planned analytic extensions: biomarkers evaluation strategy (Q11), fragmentation metrics (Q12), hyperbolic geometry rationale (Q13).
- Include meta-analysis best practices (Q14) in statistical analysis subsection (effect sizes, bias checks, multivariate handling).

## 3. Results Integration
- Insert new paragraphs summarizing:
  - Clinical biomarker findings (diagnostic accuracy, prognostic value).
  - Mechanistic fragmentation insights (local vs global dissociation, compensatory loops).
  - Hyperbolic sweet spot evidence extended with cognitive/geometric rationale.

## 4. Discussion Enhancements
- Discuss clinical implications (diagnostics, treatment monitoring), referencing Q11.
- Explain theoretical synthesis (fragmentation mechanisms, TEA/dementia comparisons) from Q12.
- Connect hyperbolic geometry to cognition and ML (Q13) and potential pathology shifts.
- Reflect on meta-analysis rigor and limitations (Q14), including bias and standardization needs.

## 5. Action Items
1. Edit Introduction (Section 1) to add new literature context.
2. Update Methods (Section 2) with expanded statistical/meta framework.
3. Add subsections to Results (Section 3) for biomarker and fragmentation findings.
4. Revise Discussion (Section 4) to integrate new implications and limitations.
5. Ensure references list captures new key citations from Q9–Q14.
