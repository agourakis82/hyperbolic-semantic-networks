**What to look for:**
- ✅ Did they measure clustering coefficient in patients?
- ✅ Did they compare early vs. chronic schizophrenia?
- ✅ Did they find elevated/reduced clustering?
- ✅ Did they use geometric analysis (curvature)?

**Time:** 1 hour (find + download + quick scan)

### **ACTION 2: Download Siew (2019) Review** ⭐⭐⭐

**Exact citation (we know):**
```
Siew, C. S., Wulff, D. U., Beckage, N. M., & Kenett, Y. N. (2019).
Cognitive network science: A review of research on cognition through the lens of network representations, processes, and dynamics.
Complexity, 2019, 2108423.
DOI: 10.1155/2019/2108423
```

**How to download:**
1. Direct DOI link: https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/2108423
2. Or search: https://scholar.google.com + DOI
3. Open access journal - should be free!

**What to do:**
- Download full PDF
- Go to REFERENCES section (expect 100-200 refs!)
- Scan for ANY paper mentioning "curvature" or "geometry"
- List all papers on "semantic networks + disorders"

**Time:** 1 hour (download + scan references)

---

### **ACTION 3: Download Mota et al. (2012) Speech Graphs** ⭐⭐

**Exact citation (we know):**
```
Mota, N. B., et al. (2012).
Speech graphs provide a quantitative measure of thought disorder in psychosis.
PLoS ONE, 7(4), e34928.
DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0034928
```

**How to download:**
1. Direct DOI: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0034928
2. PLoS ONE is open access!
3. Check "cited by" in Google Scholar for follow-up papers

**What to look for:**
- Methods: Which graph metrics did they use?
- Did they mention curvature? (probably NO)
- Did they find clustering differences?
- Did they analyze connectivity patterns?

**Time:** 30 min (download + quick scan)

---

### **ACTION 4: Search "Hyperbolic Embeddings" Literature** ⭐⭐

**Why:** Distinguish from our work!

**Papers to find:**
1. Nickel & Kiela (2017) - Poincaré embeddings
2. Nickel & Kiela (2018) - Learning hierarchies

**How:**
- Google Scholar: "Poincaré embeddings Nickel 2017"
- arXiv: Search cs.CL for "hyperbolic embeddings"

**Critical distinction to understand:**
```
Hyperbolic EMBEDDINGS (them):
  - Embed words as POINTS in hyperbolic space
  - Learn coordinates in Poincaré ball
  - Measure distances, not curvature
  
Our work (Ricci CURVATURE):
  - Measure curvature OF network edges
  - Network stays in Euclidean space
  - Curvature reveals geometric properties
  
→ DIFFERENT APPROACHES!
```

**What to write:**
- Clear distinction in manuscript
- Cite their work (hyperbolic representations)
- Explain our different approach (network curvature)

**Time:** 30 min

---

### **ACTION 5: Create Initial Literature Matrix** ⭐

**After downloading 3-5 papers:**

Create spreadsheet:

| Paper | Year | Curvature? | Semantics? | Disorders? | Overlap | Notes |
|-------|------|------------|------------|------------|---------|-------|
| Kenett 2018 | 2018 | ? | YES | YES | ?/3 | NEED TO READ |
| Siew 2019 | 2019 | ? | YES | YES | ?/3 | Review paper |
| Mota 2012 | 2012 | ? | YES | YES | ?/3 | Speech graphs |
| Nickel 2017 | 2017 | NO | YES | NO | 1/3 | Embeddings (different!) |

**Time:** 30 min

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA TONIGHT:**

**Minimum:**
✅ 3 papers downloaded (Kenett, Siew, Mota)  
✅ Kenett (2018) scanned (key findings extracted)  
✅ Initial overlap assessment documented  

**Ideal:**
✅ 5 papers downloaded

## 💪 **TONIGHT FOCUS:**

**SINGLE MOST CRITICAL QUESTION:**

> **"Did Kenett et al. already report hyperconnectivity in early psychosis?"**

**If YES:**
- We're CONFIRMING (not discovering)
- Position as "extension" or "validation"
- Emphasize our additions (curvature, meta-analysis, rigor)

**If NO:**
- We're DISCOVERING
- Position as "novel finding"
- Cite Kenett as precedent (topology, not hyperconnectivity)

**Answer to this question determines our ENTIRE positioning!**

**Must know by end of tonight!** 🎯
