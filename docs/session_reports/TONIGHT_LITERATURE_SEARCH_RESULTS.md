# 📚 TONIGHT LITERATURE SEARCH - INITIAL RESULTS

**Date:** 2025-11-06 (Evening)  
**Time Spent:** 1h  
**Queries Executed:** 5 CRITICAL  
**Status:** Initial screening in progress

---

## 🔍 **SEARCH RESULTS SUMMARY:**

### **Query 1: "Ricci curvature" + "semantic network"**

**Result:** Web search não retornou papers específicos

**Manual knowledge:**
- Ni et al. (2015, 2019) - OR curvature em INTERNET topology (not semantic!)
- Samal et al. (2018) - OR curvature em financial/biological networks
- **NO papers found** on semantic/linguistic networks with Ricci curvature

**Preliminary Assessment:** ✅ Likely NOVEL combination!

---

### **Query 2: "Ollivier-Ricci" + "language/linguistic"**

**Result:** No specific papers returned

**Manual knowledge:**
- OR curvature used in: Internet, brain, social, biological networks
- **NO application to** word networks, semantic networks, language data

**Preliminary Assessment:** ✅ Likely NOVEL application!

---

### **Query 3: "Hyperbolic" + "semantic"**

**Result:** Generic info

**Known work (from memory):**
- Hyperbolic embeddings for word2vec (Nickel & Kiela, 2017?)
- Poincaré embeddings (word embeddings in hyperbolic space)
- **BUT:** Embeddings ≠ Network curvature!
  - They embed words IN hyperbolic space
  - We measure curvature OF network itself
  - **Different approaches!**

**Action needed:** Search "Poincaré embeddings" literature to clarify distinction

---

### **Query 4: Kenett + schizophrenia + semantic network**

**Known papers (need to read):**
1. Kenett et al. (2011) - Global/local Hebrew lexicon
2. Kenett et al. (2014) - Creativity semantic networks
3. Kenett et al. (2016) - Asperger associative mind
4. Kenett et al. (2018) - **Schizophrenia semantic networks** (CRITICAL!)

**Questions to answer:**
- Did Kenett use clustering coefficient? (probably YES)
- Did Kenett find hyperconnectivity in FEP/early stage? (NEED TO CHECK!)
- Did Kenett compute curvature? (probably NO)
- Did Kenett compare patient vs. healthy quantitatively? (NEED TO CHECK!)

**Status:** ⏳ Need to download and read Kenett (2018) ASAP!

---

### **Query 5: Mota + speech graph + geometry**

**Known:**
- Mota et al. (2012) - Speech graphs psychosis
  - Used: Graph theory metrics
  - Reported: Clustering, connectivity, components
  - **Did NOT use:** Curvature (as far as we know)

**Questions:**
- Did later Mota papers (2014, 2017) add curvature? (NEED TO CHECK!)
- Did they find hyperconnectivity? (NEED TO CHECK!)

**Status:** ⏳ Need to download Mota papers!

---

## 🎯 **PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT (HONEST):**

### **What APPEARS to be NOVEL (tentative!):**

1. ✅ **OR curvature applied to semantic/word networks**
   - No papers found combining these
   - Curvature used in OTHER network types (not semantic)
   - **Confidence:** 70% novel

2. ✅ **Sweet spot [0.02-0.15] quantification**
   - Clustering-curvature relationship known (physics)
   - But specific quantification in semantic networks? Unclear
   - **Confidence:** 50% novel (need more search)

3. ⚠️ **FEP hyperconnectivity**
   - Kenett may have reported this!
   - CRITICAL to read Kenett (2018) carefully
   - **Confidence:** 30% novel (Kenett probably found this!)

4. ✅ **Window paradox, Dilution effect**
   - Very specific, methodological
   - Unlikely others tested systematically
   - **Confidence:** 80% novel

5. ⚠️ **U-shaped depression pattern**
   - Social media specific (HelaDepDet)
   - Others may have found in clinical samples
   - **Confidence:** 60% novel

## 📊 **CONFIDENCE MATRIX:**

| Contribution | Confidence Novel | Need to Check |
|--------------|------------------|---------------|
| OR curvature + semantic networks | 70% | Ni papers, geometric network lit |
| Sweet spot quantification | 50% | Physics lit, clustering-curvature |
| FEP hyperconnectivity | 30% | **Kenett 2018 CRITICAL!** |
| Window paradox | 80% | NLP co-occurrence lit |
| Dilution effect (C ∝ n^(-0.6)) | 80% | Corpus linguistics, sampling lit |
| U-shaped depression | 60% | Clinical depression network lit |
| Cross-disorder meta-analysis | 70% | Psychiatric network lit |

**Overall Assessment:**
- **Some elements likely novel** (curvature + semantics, methodological findings)
- **Some elements uncertain** (FEP hyperconnectivity - Kenett may have it!)
- **Need to read:** Kenett (2018) TONIGHT if possible!

## 🚨 **CRITICAL PRIORITY - TONIGHT/TOMORROW:**

### **MUST READ ASAP:**

1. **Kenett et al. (2018) - Schizophrenia semantic networks**
   - **Why:** May already report hyperconnectivity in early psychosis
   - **Impact:** If YES, we're confirming (not discovering!)
   - **Action:** Download and read TONIGHT (2h)

2. **Siew et al. (2019) - Cognitive network science review**
   - **Why:** Comprehensive review - will cite relevant work
   - **Impact:** May identify papers we missed
   - **Action:** Skim tomorrow, focus on References section

3. **Mota et al. (2012, follow-ups) - Speech graphs**
   - **Why:** May have done geometric analysis
   - **Impact:** Check if curvature was computed
   - **Action:** Read tomorrow

## 📋 **ACTION ITEMS - TONIGHT (2-3h):**

### **Action 1: Find & Download Kenett (2018)** (30 min)

**Search:**
- Google Scholar: "Kenett 2018 schizophrenia semantic network"
- Title likely: "...semantic networks in schizophrenia..."
- Check via CAPES access

**Download:** PDF to `/mnt/c/Users/demet/Downloads/Literature Review/`

---

### **Action 2: Read Kenett (2018) - FAST SCAN** (1h)

**Focus on:**
- Methods: Did they use clustering coefficient?
- Results: Did they find elevated/decreased clustering in patients?
- Specific: Did they analyze FEP (early) separately?
- Comparison: Patient vs. healthy quantitative?
- Geometry: ANY mention of curvature?

**Extract:**
- Exact clustering values (if reported)
- Patient vs. control comparison
- Stage effects (early vs. chronic)

---

### **Action 3: Update Literature Tracker** (30 min)

Add Kenett (2018) findings:
- Overlap assessment (Low/Medium/High)
- Gap identification (what they didn't do that we did)
- Positioning notes (how to cite them)

---

### **Action 4: Initial Positioning Statement** (30 min)

**Based on Kenett (2018) findings:**

**If they found hyperconnectivity:**
```
"While Kenett et al. (2018) reported altered semantic network topology 
in schizophrenia, geometric characterization using Ricci curvature and 
cross-disorder validation with meta-analytic synthesis remains limited. 
Here, we extend this work by..."
```

**If they didn't:**
```
"Building on topological analyses of semantic networks in psychopathology 
(Kenett et al., 2018; Siew et al., 2019), we introduce geometric 
characterization via Ollivier-Ricci curvature, revealing..."
```

---

## 🎯 **TONIGHT GOAL:**

**By end of tonight (2-3h work):**

✅ Kenett (2018) downloaded and read  
✅ Initial overlap assessment  
✅ Preliminary positioning statement  
✅ Literature tracker updated  
✅ Critical gaps identified  

**Tomorrow:** Continue with full systematic review (8h)

---

## 💪 **COMMITMENT:**

**Honestidade TOTAL!** [[memory:10560840]]

Se Kenett já reportou hyperconnectivity:
- ✅ Citaremos generously
- ✅ Posicionaremos como "extension"
- ✅ Emphasizaremos nossa contribuição (curvature, meta-analysis, rigor)
- ✅ NÃO clamaremos "first" (dishonest!)

**Better to know NOW than in peer review!**
