| Kenett 2018 | ? | YES | YES | ?/3 |
| Siew 2019 | ? | YES | YES | ?/3 |
| Mota 2012 | ? | YES | YES | ?/3 |
| Ni 2015 | YES | ? | NO | ?/3 |

**Gap Analysis:**
- What combination is MISSING in literature?
- What is our unique contribution?

---

### **DAY 7 (Nov 13): POSITIONING STATEMENT**

**Write HONEST assessment:**

```markdown
# LITERATURE REVIEW FINDINGS

## What Others DID:
- [List all relevant prior work]

## What Others DIDN'T do:
- [Genuine gaps we fill]

## Our Contribution:
- [Honest, evidence-based positioning]

## Novelty Claims (Revised):
- [Conservative or strong, based on evidence]
```

**Decision point:**
- If literature is sparse → Claim novelty (confident!)
- If literature is rich → Claim comprehensiveness (safe!)
- If we missed obvious work → REVISE extensively!

---

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

**After Week 1, we will KNOW:**

✅ **If curvature + semantics has been done**  
✅ **If sweet spot concept exists**  
✅ **If FEP hyperconnectivity is known**  
✅ **If our methodology is unique**  
✅ **What is GENUINELY novel**  

**Then we can claim with CONFIDENCE!**

---

## 📊 **EXPECTED OUTCOMES:**

### **Scenario A: Sparse Literature (Best!)** 🎉

**Finding:** <5 papers with direct overlap

**Interpretation:**
- Genuinely novel combination!
- Interdisciplinarity paid off!
- Nature-tier novelty ✅

**Action:**
- Claim "first systematic application..."
- Emphasize pioneering work
- Submit Nature with confidence

---

### **Scenario B: Moderate Literature (Likely)** 📚

**Finding:** 5-15 papers with partial overlap

**Interpretation:**
- Elements exist separately
- Our INTEGRATION is novel
- Our SCOPE is unprecedented

**Action:**
- Claim "comprehensive analysis..."
- Acknowledge prior work generously
- Emphasize scope + rigor + clinical
- Still Nature-worthy!

---

### **Scenario C: Rich Literature (Concerning)** ⚠️

**Finding:** >20 papers with substantial overlap

**Interpretation:**
- We missed a whole subfield!
- Not as novel as thought
- Need major repositioning

**Action:**
- Revise claims substantially
- Focus on incremental contributions
- Target specialized journal (not Nature)
- Or: Find different angle

---

## 💪 **COMMITMENT TO PROCESS:**

**Para CADA paper encontrado:** [[memory:10560840]]

✅ Read carefully (not just abstract!)  
✅ Extract methods (exactly what they did)  
✅ Note overlaps (honest assessment)  
✅ Identify gaps (what they didn't do)  
✅ Credit appropriately (cite generously!)  

**NO shortcuts, NO assumptions!**

---

## 🚀 **STARTING TONIGHT:**

### **Action 1: Create Literature Database (30 min)**

Spreadsheet with:
- Paper ID, Authors, Year, Journal
- Title, DOI, Status (To read / Reading / Read)
- Methods used (Curvature? Semantics? Disorders?)
- Overlap score (0-3)
- Key findings
- Notes

**File:** `data/literature_review_database.xlsx`

---

### **Action 2: Execute Q1-Q2 Searches (1h)**

**Most critical queries:**
- Q1: "Ricci curvature" + "semantic network"
- Q2: "Ollivier-Ricci" + "language"

**If we find 0 papers:**
- Excellent news! (probably novel)

**If we find >0 papers:**
- READ IMMEDIATELY (highest priority!)
- Assess overlap
- Adjust claims

---

### **Action 3: Start Kenett Bibliography (30 min)**

- Google Scholar: "YN Kenett" author search
- Download ALL semantic network papers
- Create reading queue

---

## 📅 **TIMELINE COMMITMENT:**

**TONIGHT:** Setup + initial search (2h)  
**TOMORROW:** Full day literature review (8h)  
**WEEK 1:** Complete literature review  
**WEEK 2:** Expert consultation  
**WEEK 3:** Preprint  
**WEEK 4:** Nature submission  

**4 weeks to do it RIGHT!** 🔬

---

## ✅ **WHY THIS IS WORTH IT:**

**Scenario:** Imaginesubmitting Nature NOW

**Risk:**
```
Reviewer 1: "Authors claim this is novel, but Kenett et al. (2020) 
already showed hyperconnectivity in FEP using similar methods. 
Major oversight. REJECT."
```

**Disaster!** ❌

---

**vs. Validating FIRST:**

**Week 1:** Find Kenett (2020) in our review  
**Week 2:** Email Kenett, discuss  
**Week 3:** Revise to "extend" rather than "discover"  
**Week 4:** Submit with proper positioning  

**Result:**
```
Reviewer 1: "Nice extension of Kenett et al. (2020) with 
larger scale and cross-disorder validation. ACCEPT with revisions."
```

**Success!** ✅

---
