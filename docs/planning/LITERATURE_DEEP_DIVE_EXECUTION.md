# 📚 LITERATURA DEEP DIVE - Execution Plan
**Key Finding:** Ref [15] Jost & Liu (2014) discusses clustering + curvature!  
**Priority:** Extract findings from this paper FIRST  
**Then:** Comprehensive review of all 29+ references  
**Darwin:** Cross-repo knowledge mining activated

## 🎯 PRIORITY #1: Jost & Liu (2014)

**Citation:**
> Jost, J., & Liu, S. (2014). Ollivier's Ricci curvature, local clustering 
> and curvature-dimension inequalities on graphs. 
> *Discrete & Computational Geometry*, 51(2), 300-322.

**Why Critical:**
- Title explicitly mentions "local clustering"
- Published in top discrete geometry journal
- Theoretical treatment of OR curvature
- MAY have theoretical predictions about C vs. κ

**Questions to Answer:**
1. Do they derive relationship between C and κ?
2. Do they predict positive or negative correlation?
3. Do they test empirically?
4. How do they interpret clustering effect?

**Action:** Need to locate and read this paper (PDF or abstract minimum)
