# 🔬 VALIDATION STRATEGY - PRE-SUBMISSION RIGOR

**Decision:** VALIDATE FIRST before Nature submission  
**Principle:** Better to find gaps NOW than in peer review [[memory:10560840]]  
**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks BEFORE Nature submission  
**Date:** 2025-11-06  
**Status:** INITIATED

---

## 🎯 **WHY THIS IS THE RIGHT CHOICE:**

### **Advantages:**

1. ✅ **De-risk embarrassment**
   - Find missed literature NOW (not in peer review!)
   - Identify flaws before reviewers do
   - Strengthen novelty claims with evidence

2. ✅ **Improve quality**
   - Expert feedback improves manuscript
   - Community input via preprint
   - Additional validation from field

3. ✅ **Build support**
   - Experts become aware of work
   - May offer collaboration
   - Potential endorsements for Nature

4. ✅ **Scientific integrity**
   - Thorough literature review (scholarly!)
   - Honest assessment of novelty
   - Credit prior work appropriately
   - **PhD-level rigor!**

**Email Template:**

```
Subject: Seeking feedback on geometric analysis of semantic networks in psychopathology

Dear Professor [Name],

I am an independent researcher working on geometric characterization of semantic networks 
in psychiatric disorders. Given your seminal work on [specific contribution], I would 
greatly value your expert feedback before submitting to a high-impact journal.

Brief Summary:
- Applied Ollivier-Ricci curvature to semantic networks (word associations, speech, social media)
- Found hyperbolic "sweet spot" (clustering ∈ [0.02-0.15])
- Patient-control comparison: FEP shows hyperconnectivity (+208%), Depression shows U-shaped pattern
- Meta-analysis: pooled d=+1.24 (significant)
- 12 datasets, 7 languages, extensive methodological validation

Specific Question:
Has this geometric approach (OR curvature + semantic networks + psychopathology) been done before? 
Am I missing critical literature?

I have prepared:
- Complete manuscript draft
- Comprehensive code/data (GitHub)
- Systematic validations

I would be grateful for:
1. Feedback on novelty (am I reinventing the wheel?)
2. Suggested references I may have missed
3. Potential collaboration if of interest

Preprint available at: [arXiv link after Week 3]

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Demetrios Agourakis
